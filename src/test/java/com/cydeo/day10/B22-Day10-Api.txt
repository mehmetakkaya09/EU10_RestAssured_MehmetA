json schema validation
interview speech, status codes, how to get them (4xx)

====================================
Can you do assertion if you are getting xml response in restassured ? 
You have talked about verifiying JSON, can do you verification with xml payload ? 

Yes, just like jsonPath we have xmlPath class from response object in restassured.
so I know how to retrieve value from xml response with xml path I can get any tag value or attribute value and do assertion. 

//getting xml response and assign to xmlPath 
        XmlPath xmlPath = response.xmlPath();

        String givenName = xmlPath.getString("MRData.DriverTable.Driver.GivenName");

        String driverId = xmlPath.getString("MRData.DriverTable.Driver.@driverId");

we navigate between parent child with using . and if there is multiple elements we can use index.

in order to get attribute we use @ sign. 

==========================================

SOAP(Simple Object Access Protocol)

- It has strict rule on how to send request and response.
- Soap Request use XML format to send and receive respones 
- ONLY method allowed in SOAP is POST 
- The content type is always XML 
- Body is enclosed in envelop like structure example;

ONE SOAP REQUEST 

-URL: https://www.dataaccess.com/webservicesserver/NumberConversion.wso

-Request Header: Content-Type  text/xml;charset=utf-8

-Request Body: 

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<soap:Envelope xmlns:soap="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/">
  <soap:Body>
    <NumberToWords xmlns="http://www.dataaccess.com/webservicesserver/">
      <ubiNum>500</ubiNum>
    </NumberToWords>
  </soap:Body>
</soap:Envelope>

Json Schema Validation

Json Schema is description about Json Data.

{
"id": 10,
"name": "Lorenza",
"gender": "Female",
"phone": 3312820936
}

id--> required, integer , ip to 6 digits
name --> required, string, up to 30char
gender --> optional ,Male or Female
phone --> optional long, default 0 



to create json schema in case you need it --> https://www.jsonschema.net/home

to manually test json schema --> https://www.jsonschemavalidator.net/

STEPS for VALIDATION 
1.You will get JSON schema for each endpoint you have that is returning JSON BODY/Payload
2.Save those .json files under resources folder 
3.Add Json schema validator depedenceny to your pom.xml 
	   <dependency>
            <groupId>io.rest-assured</groupId>
            <artifactId>json-schema-validator</artifactId>
            <version>4.4.0</version>
        </dependency>
4.Then perform required api request to test specific schema example:
	you are getting one spartan, you will test with singleSpartanSchema.json file 

.then()
        .statusCode(200)
        .body(JsonSchemaValidator.matchesJsonSchemaInClasspath("SingleSpartanSchema.json"));

JsonSchemaValidator --> class that we use for schema validation 

if the file under resources we use matchesJsonSchemaInClasspath("filename") method.
file name will be enough.

if the file is not under resouserces then we use matchesJsonSchema(new File("file path under project(starts with src/")) to provide file to JsonSchemaValidator class.
=============================================================
HTTP vs HTTPS
HTTPS--> secure connection,secure HTTP
Anytime you visit a website which is https, secured an ecnrypted connection will be setup between you and the server.
it means when you type card nummbers, data cannot be stolen on the way.
sometimes api also require certificates.

given().relaxedHTTPSValidation() --> is to trust the api without providing certificate
given().keyStore("pathtofile","password")
            .when().get("apiurl")

for postman --> preferences --> certificate tab 

=============================================================
How to verify response time with Restassured library ? 

once we sent the request after then(). method there is time(Matchers) method which takes the response time and based on the matcher we provide it will do assertion.
we can use greaterThan(), lessThan(), or both at the same time.
	  given()
      .auth().basic("admin", "admin")
                .accept(ContentType.JSON)
                .when()
                .get("/api/spartans")
                .then()
                .time(both(greaterThan(500L)).and(lessThanOrEqualTo(1100L)))
                .extract().response();

HTTP REQUEST TYPES
GET
POST
PUT
PATCH
DELETE

GET
REQUEST
	-url+enpoint
	-parameters
		-QueryParameter
		-PathParameter
    -headers
    	-Accept,application/json,xml,etc..
    	-Authorization , credentials,username,password,accesToken
RESPONSE
	-status code
		-2xx
		-4xx
		-5xx
	-headers
		-Content-type
		-other headers(Date) etc.
	-body
		-json
		-xml
		-text
		-...
HTTP STATUS CODES
2xx --Successful
	200 OK --> most common success status code, GET is returning, other we might get it to
	201 CREATED --> we will be getting it for POST request almost always
	204 No Content --> successful but no respond body(json,xml) only headers and status code.
					-->PUT,PATCH,DELETE
4xx --> Client Error
	400 Bad Request -->Sending bad data to server
					--example, when we post something to spartan, if we dont have proper json body, it will return 400
	401 Unauthorized --> no credentials, api does not know who we are.no token etc.
					--example,try to get spartan :7000 without providing username and password
	403 Forbidden --> we have credentials but dont have right/permission to do action
	404 Not Found --> the resource you are looking for does not exist
	405 Method Not Allowed --> cannot perform this http method on the endpoint
				     --example: /api/spartans/10 is valid for GET but if you use POST it will give you 405. basically endpoint is valid , only does not support the method you used.
    406 Not Acceptable --> Endpoint only support gettin the responce in certain format and we asked for a format that not acceptable.Example:
    	we can get All spartans as an xml result but for indiviual spartan like /api/spartans/10 with header accept, application/xml will return 406.
    415 Unsupported media type --> server is expecting to get the body in certain content type, but the client sent unsupported content type.
    	examlpe: if we use content-type application/xml to POST something to spartans, it will complain with 415
5xx --> Server error
	500 Internal Server Error --> the server encountered and unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfiling th request.
	Example: B22 is sending request. Or asking application/json/xml to ords api as a Accept
	503 Service Unavailable --> the server is currently unable to handle the reuqest due to a temporary overload or scheduled maintenance. 


How do you test rest api?
 I verify if each REST API endpoint is working as expected.
I send GET, POST,PUT,PATCH,DELETE type of requests and verify response status code and response body, headers. 

I also do positive and negative testing of API.
 When I do positive testing, I send valid request parameters , valid headers, valid request json body and verify that response status code is 200 successful and Json response body data is also matching the expected.

 When I do negative testing, I send invalid request parameters , or invalid headers, or invalid request json body and verify that response status code is NOT 200 and Json response body contains error message.
------------------------

I also do JSON Schema validation with comparing result against the schema. I verify requirements for each fields like, what could be the values, min,maxlengh
boundries. I can automate all of those process including json schema validation

Mostly I use postman as a manual api testing tool but I can use it for automation too. I have java maven project where I use RestAssured library and Jackson databinding for automating rest api. I have pojo classes for request and response Json body, I implement serialization and deserialization with the help of Jackson library.

 How does API Authentication work in your application ? 
I send a get request to special api endpoint with providing valid credentials (username,password or email,password), then it returns  AccessToken. I use that token in my request header and access other api endpoints. I always send accesstoken with all of my requests through headers.
